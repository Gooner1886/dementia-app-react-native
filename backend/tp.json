                "content": "Expand all\nWhat's the difference between Alzheimer's and dementia?Alzheimer’s disease is a type of dementia. There are hundreds of different types and causes of dementia, all categorised as progressive conditions that cause damage to the brain. Alzheimer’s is the most common type, accounting for more than 60% of diagnoses amongst people over 65 years old. Each type of dementia has different symptoms, but they are mostly identified by changes in concentration, memory, ability to do everyday things and sometimes personality and behaviour.\n\nI keep forgetting what I'm doing - do I have dementia?Everyone occasionally loses their keys, or goes into a room and forgets why they’re there. It is also perfectly natural to mix up people’s names and sometimes forget appointments that you’ve made. These memory lapses often – unfortunately – become more frequent as we get older, or when we are busy or distracted. In all probability, they do not mean that you have Alzheimer’s, or any other type of dementia.\nA good rule of thumb is that if you are worrying about your memory, and you noticing your own lapses as they come and go, then it’s unlikely you have dementia.\n\nShould I go to my GP about my memory lapses?If you are aware of your own memory lapses and they do not appear to be getting worse with time, it is very unlikely that you have dementia. The changes in the brain that happen when someone has dementia can make it difficult for that person to think clearly about the impact their own memory issues are having. So if you are worrying that your memory is getting worse, but no one else who knows you is, you probably do not need to go and see your doctor.\nThere are many factors that can affect your memory that are not related to dementia: a lack of sleep, stress, the menopause, physical ill health, vitamin deficiency or a change in medication can all affect your memory.\nThere are things you can try which will improve your overall health, which as a result, can help with improving your memory, as well as delaying the onset of dementia.\n\nWhen should I go to my GP to have my memory tested?You should visit your GP if problems with your memory have started to have an impact on your life. This might mean that you are struggling to do your job or having difficulty with everyday living; or you are regularly forgetting where you are supposed to be, or are becoming increasingly muddled with things that used to be easy for you to do.\nIf you witness these symptoms in someone else you know, you could encourage them to visit their GP.\n\nWhat if the person won't visit the GP?The person may be feeling frightened of getting a diagnosis and may think that they will lose their independence or have to go into care. In some cases, they may not understand that there are concerns about their memory or behaviour and deny they have a problem.\nYou could reassure the person that their symptoms might be due to another potentially treatable condition, such as a physical illness, depression or an infection, which might help them be more willing to visit the GP.\nIf the person simply refuses to go to the GP, you can contact the surgery to explain the situation. The GP may be able to provide a home visit to speak to the person about their symptoms.\nAs someone close to them, you could write a letter, telephone or email the person’s GP outlining your concerns. The GP may not be prepared to discuss confidential information with you, but they should welcome relevant information about the person’s current health and concerns.\n\nHow does a GP test for dementia?Currently there are no physical tests for dementia available on the NHS, although one is being trialled, but scientists are continuously working on finding accurate ways to diagnose the condition, for example through blood tests and scans. There are, however, a range of tests that GPs will do, to rule out any other physical causes for the problems you are having. Other mental health conditions will also be ruled out such as depression, stress and anxiety. A GP may give you a questionnaire about how you feel to test for depression.\nIn addition, a GP might ask you a series of questions to establish if you are having problems with your concentration, memory, reasoning and spatial awareness. These might include asking what is the day, time or year; who the Prime Minister is; and asking you to perform a task, such as counting backwards from 100.\nIf you are taking a relative to the doctor about their memory, it is worth telling the GP any facts about your relative which might affect this test: for instance, someone who worked as an accountant or who has always been very good with numbers might continue to be good with numbers even with dementia. So counting backwards from 100 might not be a good indication of cognitive impairment in that person",
