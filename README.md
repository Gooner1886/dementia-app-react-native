# Steps to Run the app after cloning

### After you have cloned the application in your local machine, open it with any IDE of your choice
### Switch to the feature branch you have created in GITHUB from the main branch
### Run npm install in the terminal to download all the dependencies and packages required which are present in the package.json file
### Run npm start to start the application. 
### You will see a QR code in the terminal when running the app, scan the QR Code using EXPO Go app to view the app in your mobile device. If that does not work, the app will run in your laptop on the web and the localhost link for that will also be present in the terminal.
### Click on the localhost link and open the inspect tab in your browser and switch to a mobile device of your choice to view the app.
